# Project 0
Project Zero

    By Yusuf A. Khan

    “Project0” contains 2 subfolders which are called “CSS” and “CSS_Map” and 14 files.

    The CSS subfolder houses all the Bootstrap 4 files.  I only used Bootstrap-Grid.CSS on my file called Project0.HTML

    The CSS_Map subfolder was made when I used the command in terminal “SASS --Watch Project0/styles.css:css_map/style.css”  This is the style sheet that is being mapped using the SCSS file. I copied and pasted this map style sheet into “style.css”  because whenever I saved a change on styles.scss it would delete all the code I’d written and replaced it with code needed to read the SCSS file, which is why I am left with two style.css files!
